# The mlr3verse

The R ecosystem offers numerous packages for machine learning, each with its own interface, conventions, and capabilities. While this diversity provides flexibility, it also creates challenges for practitioners who must learn different APIs for different algorithms and spend time on repetitive data preparation tasks. The mlr3verse addresses these challenges by providing a unified, consistent framework for machine learning in R.

## The Philosophy of mlr3verse

The mlr3verse follows a modular design philosophy that separates different aspects of the machine learning workflow into distinct, interchangeable components. This separation of concerns makes it easier to experiment with different combinations of preprocessing steps, algorithms, and evaluation strategies without rewriting code.



Rather than monolithic functions that handle everything from data preprocessing to model evaluation, mlr3verse provides specialized objects for each component of the machine learning pipeline. Tasks define the problem and data, learners implement algorithms, measures specify evaluation metrics, and resamplings control validation strategies. This modular approach promotes code reusability and makes it easier to understand and maintain complex machine learning workflows.

The framework emphasizes object-oriented design, leveraging R6 classes to provide consistent interfaces across different components. This design ensures that similar operations work the same way regardless of which specific algorithm or evaluation metric you're using. Once you learn the basic patterns, you can easily work with new algorithms and techniques.

Reproducibility receives special attention in mlr3verse. All random operations can be controlled through seed settings, and the framework provides tools to track and reproduce experimental results. This focus on reproducibility is essential for scientific applications and helps practitioners debug and iterate on their models.

## The mlr3verse Ecosystem

The mlr3verse consists of several interconnected packages, each focused on specific aspects of machine learning. Understanding these components helps practitioners choose the right tools for their projects and leverage the full power of the ecosystem.

| Package | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| mlr3 | Core framework | Tasks, learners, measures, resampling |
| mlr3learners | Extended algorithms | Additional ML algorithms beyond base mlr3 |
| mlr3pipelines | Preprocessing & pipelines | Feature engineering, model stacking |
| mlr3tuning | Hyperparameter optimization | Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization |
| mlr3measures | Additional metrics | Extended evaluation measures |
| mlr3viz | Visualization | Plotting utilities for models and results |
| mlr3filters | Feature selection | Filter-based feature selection methods |

The core mlr3 package provides the foundation, implementing basic tasks, learners, and evaluation procedures. It includes common algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees, along with fundamental evaluation metrics and resampling strategies.

mlr3learners extends the available algorithms significantly, providing interfaces to popular R packages like randomForest, glmnet, and xgboost. This extension allows practitioners to access state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining the consistent mlr3 interface.

mlr3pipelines introduces powerful preprocessing and model composition capabilities. It allows users to chain together multiple preprocessing steps, combine different algorithms, and create complex model architectures. This package particularly shines in scenarios requiring sophisticated feature engineering or ensemble methods.

mlr3tuning automates the search for optimal hyperparameters, implementing various optimization strategies from simple grid search to sophisticated Bayesian optimization. Hyperparameter tuning can dramatically improve model performance, but it requires careful validation to avoid overfitting.

## Core mlr3 Concepts and Objects

The mlr3 framework organizes machine learning workflows around four fundamental object types: 

- **Tasks** provide the data and problem definition.
- **Learners** implement the algorithms.
- **Measures** evaluate performance.
- **Resamplings** ensure robust validation. 

Understanding these objects and how they interact forms the foundation for effective use of the mlr3verse. The goal is to provide a consistent, reusable interface for machine learning tasks, allowing practitioners to focus on solving problems rather than learning different APIs.

Tasks encapsulate the machine learning problem, combining data with metadata about the prediction target and feature types. Classification tasks specify categorical targets, while regression tasks involve continuous targets. Tasks handle many routine data management operations automatically, such as identifying feature types and managing factor levels. They also provide methods for data manipulation, including filtering rows, selecting features, and creating subsets.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(mlr3verse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(data.table)

# Load Palmer Penguins dataset
data(penguins)
penguins <- na.omit(penguins)
```

```{r task-example}
# Create a classification task with Palmer Penguins data
task <- as_task_classif(penguins, target = "species")

# Examine task properties
task$nrow  # Number of observations
task$ncol  # Number of features
task$feature_names  # Names of predictor variables
task$target_names  # Name of target variable
```

Learners implement machine learning algorithms, providing a consistent interface regardless of the underlying implementation. Each learner specifies its capabilities, including which task types it supports, whether it can handle missing values, and what hyperparameters are available for tuning. Learners maintain information about their training state and can generate predictions on new data.

The learner registry provides a convenient way to discover available algorithms. You can query the registry to find learners for specific task types or search for algorithms with particular capabilities.

```{r learner-exploration}
# Explore available classification learners
classif_learners <- mlr_learners$keys("classif")
head(classif_learners, 10)

# Examine a specific learner
rpart_learner <- lrn("classif.rpart")
rpart_learner$param_set$ids()  # Available hyperparameters
```

## Learner Naming Convention

mlr3 uses a consistent naming scheme for learners: `[task_type].[algorithm]`. For example, `classif.rpart` implements decision trees for classification, while `regr.lm` provides linear regression. This naming makes it easy to find appropriate algorithms for your task type.

Measures define evaluation metrics for assessing model performance. Different measures emphasize different aspects of model quality, and the choice of measure can significantly impact model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Classification measures include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, while regression measures encompass mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.

```{r measures-example}
# Common classification measures
acc_measure <- msr("classif.acc")  # Accuracy
ce_measure <- msr("classif.ce")    # Classification error
auc_measure <- msr("classif.auc")  # Area under ROC curve
```

Resamplings control how data is split for training and validation. They implement various strategies including simple holdout splits, k-fold cross-validation, and bootstrap sampling. The choice of resampling strategy affects both the reliability of performance estimates and computational requirements.

```{r resampling-example}
# Different resampling strategies
holdout <- rsmp("holdout", ratio = 0.8)  # 80/20 split
cv5 <- rsmp("cv", folds = 5)             # 5-fold cross-validation
bootstrap <- rsmp("bootstrap", repeats = 30)  # Bootstrap sampling

# Examine resampling properties
cv5$param_set
```

These four object types work together to create complete machine learning workflows. Tasks provide the data and problem definition, learners implement the algorithms, measures evaluate performance, and resamplings ensure robust validation. This modular design allows practitioners to mix and match components easily, experimenting with different combinations to find optimal solutions for their specific problems.

The interaction between these objects follows predictable patterns. Learners train on tasks, producing fitted models that can generate predictions. These predictions are evaluated using measures, with resampling strategies ensuring that evaluation results generalize beyond the specific training data used. Understanding these interactions enables practitioners to build sophisticated machine learning pipelines while maintaining clear, readable code.
