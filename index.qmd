# Preface {.unnumbered}

The goal of the material is NOT to teach you R or Bioconductor, but rather to 
provide enough groundwork to enable you to learn R and Bioconductor on your own.
The idea is that we learn faster and better by developing "schemata" that
allow us to organize and understand new information. When a new concept is
introduced, it is easier to understand if it can be related to something we
already know (see @fig-schema-theory). 

![Schema theory of learning. While probably not entirely applicable to how adults learn, it does highlight the importance of building on prior knowledge. When new knowledge is introducted, it is more quickly stored into long-term memory if strongly-related concepts are already available for connection.](images/schema_theory1.png){#fig-schema-theory}

This book is a collection of resources meant to help build your data science,
statistical, and computational schemata. It is meant to 
be largely self-directed, but for those looking to teach data science, it can
also be used as a guide for structuring a course. Material is a bit variable 
in terms of difficulty, prerequisites, and format which is a reflection of the
organic creation of the material. See below for additional thoughts on 
adult learning and how it relates to this material.

## What are the goals?

We can often get lost in the weeds of technical details of lessons, focusing only on
the syntax and semantics of R and Bioconductor. Let's take a step back and
consider the big picture. The goals are to:

1. Have a foundation for reading and writing R code to solve problems and understand data.
2. Be able to find and use online resources including AI and tutorials to solve problems and learn new concepts.
3. Be able to effectively communicate with others about R code and data science concepts.
4. Most importantly, to develop the confidence to become a self-directed learner, experimenting with concepts and practice of data science to address real-world problems.

## Adult learners

Adult Learning Theory, also known as Andragogy, is the concept and practice of
designing, developing, and delivering instructional experiences for adult
learners. It is based on the belief that adults learn differently than
children, and thus, require distinct approaches to engage, motivate, and retain
information [@author_lifelong_2016]. The term was first introduced by Malcolm
Knowles, an American educator who is known for his work in adult education
[@knowles_adult_2005].

One of the fundamental principles of Adult Learning Theory is that adults are
self-directed learners. This means that we prefer to take control of our
own learning process and set personal goals for themselves. We are motivated
by our desire to solve problems or gain knowledge to improve our lives (see @fig-why-learn). As
a result, educational content for adults should be relevant and applicable to
real-life situations. Furthermore, adult learners should be given opportunities
to actively engage in the learning process by making choices, setting goals,
and evaluating their progress.

![Why do adults choose to learn something?](images/why_learn.png){#fig-why-learn}

Another key aspect of Adult Learning Theory is the role of experience. We
bring a wealth of experience to the learning process, which serves as a
resource for new learning. We often have well-established beliefs, values,
and mental models that can influence our willingness to accept new ideas and
concepts. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge and respect our shared and unique past
experiences and create an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing
our perspectives.

To effectively learn as a group of adult learners, it is crucial to establish a collaborative
learning environment that promotes open communication and fosters trust among
participants. We all appreciate and strive for a respectful and supportive atmosphere
where we can express our opinions without fear of judgment. Instructors
should help facilitate discussions, encourage peer-to-peer interactions, and
incorporate group activities and collaboration to capitalize on the collective
knowledge of participants.

Additionally, adult learners often have multiple responsibilities outside of
the learning environment, such as work and family commitments. As a result,
we require flexible learning opportunities that accommodate busy
schedules. Offering a variety of instructional formats, such as online modules,
self-paced learning, or evening classes, can help ensure that adult learners
have access to education despite any time constraints.

Adult learners benefit from a learner-centered approach that focuses on
the individual needs, preferences, and interests of each participant can
greatly enhance the overall learning experience. In addition, we tend to 
be more intrinsically motivated to learn when we have a sense of autonomy and
can practice and experiment (see @fig-stuck-ds) with new concepts in a safe environment.

Incorporate your own experience or applications whenever possible.'}

Understanding Adult Learning Theory and its 
principles can significantly enhance the effectiveness
of teaching and learning as adults. By respecting our autonomy, acknowledging our
experiences, creating a supportive learning environment, offering flexible
learning opportunities, and utilizing diverse teaching methods, we can
better cater to the unique needs and preferences of adult learners.

In practice, that means that we will will not be prescriptive in our approach
to teaching data science. We will not tell you what to do, but rather we will
provide you with a variety of options and you can choose what works best for
you. We will also provide you with a variety of resources and you can choose where
to focus your time. Given that we cannot possibly cover everything, we will
provide you with a framework for learning and you can fill in the gaps as you
see fit. A key component of our success as adult learners is to gain the confidence
to ask questions and problem-solve on our own. 

## AI is part of the solution

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasingly important tool in
education, and it can be a powerful ally in our quest to learn data science.
As it turns out, AI is excellent at helping us learn. It can provide
tailored explanations, generate practice problems, and even simulate real-world
scenarios for us to work through. AI can also help us find resources, summarize
complex topics, and even provide feedback on our work. However, it is important
to remember that AI is a tool, not a replacement for our own learning. We still
need to engage with the material, ask questions, and seek out additional resources
when needed. AI can help us learn more efficiently, but it cannot do the learning
for us.

I encourage you to use AI tools to help you learn and to even do work for you
when appropriate; AI is an excellent partner in analysis and programming. 
However, I also encourage you to be critical of the information
that AI provides. AI is not perfect and can make mistakes. 
Throughout this course and book, use AI to dive deeper into the material, to
provide additional explanations, and to generate additional depth and breadth
to the material.
