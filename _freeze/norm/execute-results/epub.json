How do I remember the difference between these?\n\nI find it helpful to have visual representations of distributions as pictures. It is difficult for me to think of distributions, or differences between probability, density, and quantiles without visualizing the shape of the distribution. So I figured it would be helpful to have a visual guide to pnorm, dnorm, qnorm, and rnorm.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n| Function | Input | Output |\n|----------|-------|--------|\n| pnorm    | x     | P(X < x) |\n| dnorm    | x     | f(x), or the height of the density curve at x   |\n| qnorm    | q, a quantile from 0 to 1    | x such that P(X < x) = q |\n| rnorm    | n     | n random samples from the distribution |\n\n: Table 1.1: Functions for the normal distribution\n\nWhat is the relationship between these functions? The pnorm function gives the area under the curve to the left of a given point, while dnorm gives the height of the curve at that point. The qnorm function is the inverse of pnorm, returning the x value for a given probability. Finally, rnorm generates random samples from the normal distribution.\n\n## pnorm\n\nThis function gives the probability function for a normal distribution. If you do not specify the mean and standard deviation, R defaults to standard normal. @fig-pnorm-1\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe R help file for pnorm provides the template above. The value you input for q is a value on the x-axis, and the returned value is the area under the distribution curve to the left of that point.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThis function gives the probability function for a normal distribution.

The value you input for q is a value on the x-axis, and the returned value is the area under the distribution curve to the left of that point.\n\nThe option lower.tail = TRUE tells R to use the area to the left of the given point. This is the default, so will remain true even without entering it. In order to compute the area to the right of the given point, you can either switch to lower.tail = FALSE, or simply calculate 1-pnorm() instead.

It is defined by two parameters: the mean (µ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the central tendency of the distribution, while the standard deviation represents the dispersion or spread of the data.\n\nThe IQ scores are an excellent example of the normal distribution, as they are designed to follow this distribution pattern. The mean IQ score is set at 100, and the standard deviation is set at 15. This means that the majority of the population (about 68%) have an IQ score between 85 and 115, while 95% of the population have an IQ score between 70 and 130.\n\n*   What is the probability of having an IQ score between 85 and 115?\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show answer\"}\n    pnorm(115, mean = 100, sd = 15) - pnorm(85, mean = 100, sd = 15)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n*   What is the 90th percentile of the IQ scores?\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show answer\"}\n    qnorm(0.9, mean = 100, sd = 15)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n*   What is the probability of having an IQ score above 130?\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show answer\"}\n    1 - pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 15)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n*   What is the probability of having an IQ score below 70?\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show answer\"}\n    pnorm(70, mean = 100, sd = 15)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n    \n",
