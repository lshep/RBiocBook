# Packages and more dice

We now have code that allows us to roll two dice and add the results together. 
To keep things interesting, let's aim to weight the dice so that we can fool
our friends into thinking we are lucky.

First, though, we should prove to ourselves that our dice are fair. We can investigate
the behavior of our dice using two powerful and general tools;

- Simulation (or repetition or repeated sampling)
- Visualization

For the repetition part of things, we will use a built-in R function, `replicate`. 
For visualization, we are going to use a convenient plotting function, `qplot`. However,
`qplot` does not come built into R. We must install a _package_ to gain access to it.


## Packages

R is a powerful language for data science and programming, allowing beginners
and experts alike to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data effectively. One
of the most appealing features of R is its extensive library of packages, which
are essential tools for expanding its capabilities and streamlining the coding
process.

An R package is a collection of reusable functions, datasets, and compiled code
created by other users and developers to extend the functionality of the base R
language. These packages cover a wide range of applications, such as data
manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
By utilizing existing R packages, you can leverage the expertise of others and
save time by avoiding the need to create custom functions from scratch.

Using others' R packages is incredibly beneficial as it allows you to take
advantage of the collective knowledge of the R community. Developers often
create packages to address specific challenges, optimize performance, or
implement popular algorithms or methodologies. By incorporating these packages
into your projects, you can enhance your productivity, reduce development time,
and ensure that you are using well-tested and reliable code.

### Installing R packages

To install an R package, you can use the `install.packages()` function in the R
console or script. For example, to install the popular data manipulation
package "dplyr," simply type install.packages("dplyr"). This command will
download the package from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and
install it on your local machine. Keep in mind that you only need to install a
package once, unless you want to update it to a newer version.

For those who are going to be using R for bioinformatics or biological data
science, you will also want to install packages from Bioconductor, which is a
repository of R packages specifically designed for bioinformatics and
computational biology. To install Bioconductor packages, you can use the
`BiocManager::install()` function. 

To use this recommended approach, you first need to install the
`BiocManager` package, which is the package manager for Bioconductor. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('BiocManager')
```

This is a one-time installation. After that, you can install any R, Bioconductor, rOpenSci, or even GitHub package using the `BiocManager::install()` function. For example, to install the `ggplot2` package, which is widely used for data visualization, you would run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("ggplot2")
```

### Installing vs loading (library) R packages

After installing an R package, you will need to load it into your R session
before using its functions. To load a package, use the `library()` function
followed by the package name, such as `library(dplyr)`. Loading a package makes
its functions and datasets available for use in your current R session. Note
that you need to load a package every time you start a new R session.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Now, the functionality of the _ggplot2_ package is available in our R session.

## Installing vs loading packages

The main thing to remember is that you only need to install a package once, but you need to load it with library each time you wish to use it in a new R session. R will unload all of its packages each time you close RStudio.

![Installing vs loading R packages.](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/img/install_vs_library.jpeg){#fig-install-vs-library}

As in {@fig-install-vs-library}, screw in the lightbulb (eg., `BiocManager::install`) only once and then to use it, you need to turn on the switch each time you want to use it (`library`).

### Finding R packages

Finding useful R packages can be done in several ways. First, browsing CRAN
(<https://cran.r-project.org/>) and Bioconductor (more later,
<https://bioconductor.org>) are an excellent starting points, as they host
thousands of packages categorized by topic. Additionally, online forums like
Stack Overflow and R-bloggers can provide valuable recommendations based on
user experiences. Social media platforms such as Twitter, where developers and
data scientists often share new packages and updates, can also be a helpful
resource. Finally, don't forget to ask your colleagues or fellow R users for
their favorite packages, as they may have insights on which ones best suit your
specific needs.

## Are our dice fair?

Well, let's review our code.

```{r}
roll2 <- function(bones = 1:6) {
  dice = sample(bones, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}
```

If our dice are fair, then each number should show up equally. What does the sum look
like with our two dice?

![In an ideal world, a histogram of the results would look like this](images/dice_combos.png){#fig-dice-combos}

Read the help page for `replicate` (i.e., `help("replicate")`). In short, it suggests
that we can repeat our dice rolling as many times as we like and replicate will return
a _vector_ of the sums for each roll.

```{r}
rolls = replicate(n = 100, roll2())
```

What does `rolls` look like?

```{r}
head(rolls)
length(rolls)
mean(rolls)
summary(rolls)
```

This looks like it roughly agrees with our sketched out ideal histogram in @fig-dice-combos. However, now that we've loaded the `qplot` function from the _ggplot2_ package, we can make a histogram of the data themselves. 

```{r fig-100-rolls, fig.cap="Histogram of the sums from 100 rolls of our fair dice"}
qplot(rolls, binwidth=1)
```

How does your histogram look (and yours will be different from mine since we are sampling random values)? Is it what you expect? 

What happens to our histogram as we increase the number of replicates?

```{r fig-10k-rolls, fig.cap="Histogram with 100000 rolls much more closely approximates the pyramidal shape we anticipated"}
rolls = replicate(n = 100000, roll2())
qplot(rolls, binwidth=1)
```

## Bonus exercise

How would you change the `roll2` function to weight the dice?

## Hint
Read the help page for `sample` (i.e., `help("sample")`).
