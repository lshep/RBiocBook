When a new concept is\nintroduced, it is easier to understand if it can be related to something we\nalready know (see @fig-schema-theory). \n\n![Schema theory of learning. While probably not entirely applicable to how adults learn, it does highlight the importance of building on prior knowledge. When new knowledge is introducted, it is more quickly stored into long-term memory if strongly-related concepts are already available for connection.](images/schema_theory1.png){#fig-schema-theory}\n\nThis book is a collection of resources meant to help build your data science,\nstatistical, and computational schemata. It is meant to \nbe largely self-directed, but for those looking to teach data science, it can\nalso be used as a guide for structuring a course. Material is a bit variable \nin terms of difficulty, prerequisites, and format which is a reflection of the\norganic creation of the material. See below for additional thoughts on \nadult learning and how it relates to this material.\n\n## What are the goals?\n\nWe can often get lost in the weeds of technical details of lessons, focusing only on\nthe syntax and semantics of R and Bioconductor. Let's take a step back and\nconsider the big picture. The goals are to:\n\n1. Have a foundation for reading and writing R code to solve problems and understand data.\n2. Be able to find and use online resources including AI and tutorials to solve problems and learn new concepts.\n3. Be able to effectively communicate with others about R code and data science concepts.\n4. Most importantly, to develop the confidence to become a self-directed learner, experimenting with concepts and practice of data science to address real-world problems.\n\n## Adult learners\n\nAdult Learning Theory, also known as Andragogy, is the concept and practice of\ndesigning, developing, and delivering instructional experiences for adult\nlearners. It is based on the belief that adults learn differently than\nchildren, and thus, require distinct approaches to engage, motivate, and retain\ninformation [@author_lifelong_2016]. The term was first introduced by Malcolm\nKnowles, an American educator who is known for his work in adult education\n[@knowles_adult_2005].\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of Adult Learning Theory is that adults are\nself-directed learners. This means that we prefer to take control of our\nown learning process and set personal goals for themselves. We are motivated\nby our desire to solve problems or gain knowledge to improve our lives (see @fig-why-learn). As\na result, educational content for adults should be relevant and applicable to\nreal-life situations. Furthermore, adult learners should be given opportunities\nto actively engage in the learning process by making choices, setting goals,\nand evaluating their progress.\n\n![Why do adults choose to learn something?](images/why_learn.png){#fig-why-learn}\n\nAnother key aspect of Adult Learning Theory is the role of experience. We\nbring a wealth of experience to the learning process, which serves as a\nresource for new learning. We often have well-established beliefs, values,\nand mental models that can influence our willingness to accept new ideas and\nconcepts. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge and respect our shared and unique past\nexperiences and create an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing\nour perspectives.\n\nTo effectively learn as a group of adult learners, it is crucial to establish a collaborative\nlearning environment that promotes open communication and fosters trust among\nparticipants. We all appreciate and strive for a respectful and supportive atmosphere\nwhere we can express our opinions without fear of judgment. Instructors\nshould help facilitate discussions, encourage peer-to-peer interactions, and\nincorporate group activities and collaboration to capitalize on the collective\nknowledge of participants.\n\nAdditionally, adult learners often have multiple responsibilities outside of\nthe learning environment, such as work and family commitments. As a result,\nwe require flexible learning opportunities that accommodate busy\nschedules. Offering a variety of instructional formats, such as online modules,\nself-paced learning, or evening classes, can help ensure that adult learners\nhave access to education despite any time constraints.\n\nAdult learners benefit from a learner-centered approach that focuses on\nthe individual needs, preferences, and interests of each participant can\ngreatly enhance the overall learning experience. In addition, we tend to \nbe more intrinsically motivated to learn when we have a sense of autonomy and\ncan practice and experiment (see @fig-stuck-ds) with new concepts in a safe environment. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How to stay stuck in data science (or anything). The \"Read-Do\" loop tends to deliver the best results. Too much reading between doing can be somewhat effective. Reading and simply copy-paste is probably the least effective. When working through material, experiment. Try to break things. Incorporate your own experience or applications whenever possible.](index_files/figure-epub/fig-stuck-ds-1.png){#fig-stuck-ds}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Adult Learning Theory and its \nprinciples can significantly enhance the effectiveness\nof teaching and learning as adults. By respecting our autonomy, acknowledging our\nexperiences, creating a supportive learning environment, offering flexible\nlearning opportunities, and utilizing diverse teaching methods, we can\nbetter cater to the unique needs and preferences of adult learners.\n\nIn practice, that means that we will will not be prescriptive in our approach\nto teaching data science. We will not tell you what to do, but rather we will\nprovide you with a variety of options and you can choose what works best for\nyou. We will also provide you with a variety of resources and you can choose where\nto focus your time. Given that we cannot possibly cover everything, we will\nprovide you with a framework for learning and you can fill in the gaps as you\nsee fit. A key component of our success as adult learners is to gain the confidence\nto ask questions and problem-solve on our own. \n\n## AI is part of the solution\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasingly important tool in\neducation, and it can be a powerful ally in our quest to learn data science.\nAs it turns out, AI is excellent at helping us learn. It can provide\ntailored explanations, generate practice problems, and even simulate real-world\nscenarios for us to work through. AI can also help us find resources, summarize\ncomplex topics, and even provide feedback on our work. However, it is important\nto remember that AI is a tool, not a replacement for our own learning. We still\nneed to engage with the material, ask questions, and seek out additional resources\nwhen needed. AI can help us learn more efficiently, but it cannot do the learning\nfor us.\n\nI encourage you to use AI tools to help you learn and to even do work for you\nwhen appropriate; AI is an excellent partner in analysis and programming. \nHowever, I also encourage you to be critical of the information\nthat AI provides. AI is not perfect and can make mistakes. \nThroughout this course and book, use AI to dive deeper into the material, to\nprovide additional explanations, and to generate additional depth and breadth\nto the material. \n\n",
