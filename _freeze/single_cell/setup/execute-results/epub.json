This capability has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, developmental processes, and disease mechanisms. Unlike traditional bulk RNA-seq, which provides an average expression profile across all cells in a sample, scRNA-seq reveals the unique molecular signatures of individual cells, enabling identification of distinct cell types, states, and trajectories.\n\nThis tutorial will walk through a typical scRNA-seq analysis workflow using R and the Bioconductor ecosystem. We'll cover data loading, quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization - the fundamental steps that transform raw sequencing data into biological insights.\n\n## Setup and Data Loading\n\n### Loading Essential Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load essential libraries for single-cell RNA-seq analysis\nlibrary(scRNAseq)\nlibrary(scran)\nlibrary(scater)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe start by loading three essential R packages for single-cell analysis:\n\n- **scRNAseq**: Provides access to curated single-cell RNA-seq datasets, making it easy to practice analysis techniques on real data. At the time of writing, it includes more than 50 datasets covering various tissues, organisms, and experimental conditions. See @risso2024scRNAseq\n- **scran**: Contains methods for normalization, feature selection, and clustering specifically designed for single-cell data. See @lun2016.\n- **scater**: Offers tools for quality control, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. See @McCarthy2017scater.\n\nSingle-cell data has unique characteristics (sparsity, high dimensionality, technical noise) that require specialized tools. These packages form the backbone of the Bioconductor single-cell analysis ecosystem and provide methods that account for the specific challenges of single-cell data.\n\n### Exploring Available Datasets\n\nWe are going to use the `scRNAseq` package to access a curated collection of single-cell datasets. This package provides a convenient way to load and explore publicly available datasets that have been processed and annotated. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndatasets <- scRNAseq::surveyDatasets()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `surveyDatasets()` function queries the scRNAseq package database to show all available datasets. This creates a simple table of publicly available single-cell datasets that have been processed and made easily accessible.\n\nHaving access to well-curated datasets is useful for learning and benchmarking. These datasets come from published studies and represent different tissues, conditions, and experimental designs, allowing us to practice on real biological data without having to process raw sequencing files.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nDataFrame with 10 rows and 15 columns\n                     name     version        path                 object\n              <character> <character> <character>            <character>\n1       aztekin-tail-2019  2023-12-14          NA single_cell_experiment\n2  splicing-demonstrati..  2023-12-20          NA single_cell_experiment\n3      marques-brain-2016  2023-12-19          NA single_cell_experiment\n4   grun-bone_marrow-2016  2023-12-14          NA single_cell_experiment\n5         giladi-hsc-2018  2023-12-21      crispr single_cell_experiment\n6         giladi-hsc-2018  2023-12-21         rna single_cell_experiment\n7     macosko-retina-2015  2023-12-19          NA single_cell_experiment\n8        messmer-esc-2019  2023-12-19          NA single_cell_experiment\n9  ernst-spermatogenesi..  2023-12-21  cellranger single_cell_experiment\n10 ernst-spermatogenesi..  2023-12-21  emptydrops single_cell_experiment\n                    title            description taxonomy_id   genome      rows\n              <character>            <character>      <List>   <List> <integer>\n1  Identification of a ..

The 'columns' field shows the number of cells, while 'rows' shows the number of genes. This helps you choose datasets appropriate for your computational resources and analysis goals. This little lightweight database is not the richest way to explore datasets, but it is a good starting point. In this tutorial, we will use the `ZeiselBrainData` dataset, which contains single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse brain tissue (@zeiselCellTypesMouse2015). \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Abstract: Zeisel Brain Dataset\n\nThe mammalian cerebral cortex supports cognitive functions such as sensorimotor integration, memory, and social behaviors. Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 region. We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsce <- scRNAseq::ZeiselBrainData()\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat is the `sce` object? It is a `SingleCellExperiment` object, which is a data structure specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. As with other Bioconductor data structures, it is built on top of the `SummarizedExperiment` class (see @fig-scRNAseq-sce), which allows us to store not only the count matrix but also metadata about cells and features (genes).\n\n![The SingleCellExperiment object. ](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-019-0654-x/MediaObjects/41592_2019_654_Fig2_HTML.png){#fig-scRNAseq-sce fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nPrinting the `sce` object gives us a summary of the dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsce\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass: SingleCellExperiment \ndim: 20006 3005 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(1): counts\nrownames(20006): Tspan12 Tshz1 ... mt-Rnr1 mt-Nd4l\nrowData names(1): featureType\ncolnames(3005): 1772071015_C02 1772071017_G12 ... 1772066098_A12\n  1772058148_F03\ncolData names(9): tissue group # ... level1class level2class\nreducedDimNames(0):\nmainExpName: gene\naltExpNames(2): repeat ERCC\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `SingleCellExperiment` object contains:\n\n- **Assays**: The main data matrix (counts) and any additional matrices (e.g., normalized counts).\n- **Row metadata**: Information about genes (e.g., gene names, IDs).\n- **Column metadata**: Information about cells (e.g., cell barcodes, tissue type, experimental conditions).\n\nIt **can** also contain additional information such as dimensionality reductions (e.g., PCA, t-SNE), clustering results, and quality control metrics.\n\nIn fact, we are going to add some of these additional information in the next steps. First, we add a new assay with the log-normalized counts, which is a common preprocessing step in single-cell RNA-seq analysis. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsce <- logNormCounts(sce)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `logNormCounts()` function performs log-normalization of the count data. Raw count data from scRNA-seq experiments contains technical variation due to differences in sequencing depth between cells. Some cells might have been sequenced more deeply than others, leading to higher total counts that don't reflect true biological differences. Log-normalization addresses this by:\n\n1. **Size factor normalization**: Scaling each cell's counts by a size factor that accounts for differences in sequencing dept. There are several methods to calculate size factors, but the most common is the median of ratios method, which divides each cell's counts by the median count for each gene across all cells. This helps to adjust for differences in library size.\n2. **Log transformation**: Taking log(count + 1) to stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed\n\nFor each gene g in cell i, the log-normalized expression becomes:\n\n$$log_2(count_{g_i} × {size factor}_{i} + 1)$$\n\nThis log transformation is useful because the next steps in the downstream analyses (like clustering and dimensionality reduction) assume that the data is approximately normally distributed (or at least bell-shaped). Log-normalization helps achieve this by reducing the impact of outliers and making the data more suitable for PCA and visualization.\n\n## Dimensionality reduction\n\nSingle-cell datasets are extremely high-dimensional - typically containing 15,000-30,000 genes per cell. This creates several challenges: computational complexity, noise dominance, and visualization difficulties. Dimensionality reduction techniques help us identify the most informative patterns in the data while reducing noise and computational burden.\n\n### Feature Selection: Identifying Highly Variable Genes\n\nBefore applying dimensionality reduction, we need to identify the most informative genes. Highly variable genes (HVGs) are those that show significant variation across cells, indicating they may be biologically relevant. These genes are often more informative for downstream analyses like clustering and visualization.\n\nNot all genes are equally informative for distinguishing cell types. Genes that show little variation across cells (like housekeeping genes) don't help us identify distinct cell populations. Highly variable genes are more likely to:\n\n- Reflect biological differences between cell types\n- Capture developmental or activation states\n- Represent responses to environmental conditions\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scran)\ntop_var_genes <- getTopHVGs(sce, n=2000)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `getTopHVGs()` function identifies the top 2000 highly variable genes based on their variance across cells. Choosing a subset of highly variable genes reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most informative features for downstream analyses.\n\nThe algorithm models the relationship between gene expression mean and variance, then identifies genes that show more variation than expected based on their expression level. This accounts for the fact that highly expressed genes naturally show more variance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Visualizing the highly variable genes\nlibrary(scran)\ndec <- modelGeneVar(sce)\n\n# Visualizing the fit:\nfit.mv <- metadata(dec)\nplot(fit.mv$mean, fit.mv$var, xlab=\"Mean of log-expression\",\n    ylab=\"Variance of log-expression\", ylim=c(0, 4))\ncurve(fit.mv$trend(x), col=\"dodgerblue\", add=TRUE, lwd=2)\npoints(\n    fit.mv$mean[top_var_genes], fit.mv$var[top_var_genes], \n    col=\"red\", pch=16, cex=0.5\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A plot of the mean vs variance of log-expression for all the genes in the dataset, with the highly variable genes highlighted in red. Here, the x-axis represents the mean log-expression of each gene, and the y-axis represents the variance of log-expression. The blue curve represents the trend of variance as a function of mean expression, while the red points represent the highly variable genes.](setup_files/figure-epub/fig-scRNAseq-hvg-1.png){#fig-scRNAseq-hvg}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-scRNAseq-hvg shows the mean vs. variance of log-expression for all genes in the dataset, with highly variable genes highlighted in red. The blue curve represents the trend of variance as a function of mean expression, while the red points represent the highly variable genes.\n\n\nWe next proceed to calculating PCA using the subset of highly variable genes. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that finds the directions of maximum variance in the data. It's computationally efficient and provides a good foundation for further analysis. The first few principal components capture the most important patterns of variation in the dataset. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Why PCA first? \n\nPCA is a widely _linear_ dimensionality reduction technique that:\n\n- Reduces dimensionality while preserving variance\n- Helps visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D\n- Serves as a preprocessing step for other methods like t-SNE or UMAP\n- Is computationally efficient and easy to interpret\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Perform PCA on the highly variable genes\nset.seed(100) # See below.\nsce <- fixedPCA(sce, subset.row=top_var_genes)\n\nreducedDimNames(sce)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"PCA\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that we assign the output of `fixedPCA()` to the `sce` object. This function performs PCA on the highly variable genes we identified earlier, reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most informative features. Because dimensionality reduction is a common step in single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we can store the PCA results in the `reducedDims` slot of the `SingleCellExperiment` object. This allows us to easily access and visualize the PCA coordinates later.\n\n### Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE\n\nAfter PCA, we can apply non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to visualize the data in 2D or 3D. t-SNE is particularly useful for revealing local structure and separating distinct cell populations.\n\n::: {.callout-tip)\n## Why t-SNE after PCA \n\nThis is a two-step approach:\n1. **PCA first**: Reduces noise and computational burden while preserving global structure\n2. **t-SNE second**: Reveals local neighborhood structure and separates distinct cell populations\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scater)\nsce <- runTSNE(sce, dimred=\"PCA\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `runTSNE()` function applies t-SNE to the PCA results, creating a 2D representation of the data. The `dimred=\"PCA\"` argument specifies that we want to use the PCA coordinates as input for t-SNE. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnn.clusters <- clusterCells(sce, use.dimred = \"TSNE\")\ntable(nn.clusters)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nnn.clusters\n  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20 \n152 126 190 286 131 191  63  87 113 328  88  97 155  45 138  40  71  42  61  92 \n 21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36 \n 54  64  35  62  58  32  27  32  20  16  12  20  28  15  18  16 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `clusterCells()` function uses graph-based clustering to identify groups of similar cells. Graph-based clustering was [popularized by the Seurat package](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html#cluster-the-cells). It builds a nearest-neighbor graph and then finds communities within this graph. The resulting clusters often correspond to distinct cell types or states. The `use.dimred = \"TSNE\"` argument specifies that we want to use the t-SNE coordinates for clustering. This is an important choide because t-SNE captures local structure and can reveal distinct cell populations that may not be apparent in the original high-dimensional space. There are other clustering methods available, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, but graph-based clustering is particularly effective for single-cell data due to its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships. \n\n### Visualizing Cell Types and Clusters\n\nIn this particular dataset, we have pre-defined cell type annotations that we can use to color the t-SNE plot. The `level1class` and `level2class` columns in the metadata contain these annotations. We can use these annotations to color the t-SNE plot and visualize how well the clustering aligns with known cell types.\n\nWe can cluster the cells based on their t-SNE coordinates and visualize the results. The `plotReducedDim()` function from the `scater` package allows us to create a scatter plot of the t-SNE coordinates, coloring the points by their cluster assignments or cell type annotations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scater)\ncolLabels(sce) <- nn.clusters\nplotReducedDim(sce, \"TSNE\", colour_by=\"level1class\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](setup_files/figure-epub/fig-level1-class-1.png){#fig-level1-class}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also visualize the second level of cell type annotations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplotReducedDim(sce, \"TSNE\", colour_by=\"level2class\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](setup_files/figure-epub/fig-level2-class-1.png){#fig-level2-class}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd add additional metadata such as tissue type to the plot. The `shape_by` argument allows us to differentiate points by another categorical variable, such as tissue type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplotReducedDim(sce, \"TSNE\", colour_by=\"level1class\", shape_by=\"tissue\", )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](setup_files/figure-epub/fig-level1-tissue-1.png){#fig-level1-tissue}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Finding Marker Genes\n\nMarker genes are genes that are differentially expressed in a specific cell type or cluster compared to others. Identifying marker genes helps us understand the molecular characteristics of each cell type and can provide insights into their functions.\n\nTo find marker genes, we can use the `findMarkers()` function from the `scran` package. This function performs pairwise differential expression analysis between clusters or cell types. We can specify the clusters we want to compare and the method for calculating differential expression.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmarkers <- findMarkers(sce, \n    groups=as.numeric(as.factor(colData(sce)$level1class)), pval.type=\"all\",\n    direction=\"up\", subset.row=top_var_genes, test=\"t\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `findMarkers()` function identifies genes that are significantly upregulated in each cluster compared to all other clusters. The `pval.type=\"all\"` argument specifies that we want to calculate p-values for all comparisons, and the `direction=\"up\"` argument indicates that we are interested in genes that are upregulated in the specified clusters.\n\nThe `subset.row=top_var_genes` argument restricts the analysis to the highly variable genes we identified earlier, which are more likely to be informative for distinguishing cell types.\n\nThe resulting `markers` object is a list where each element corresponds to a cluster and contains the differential expression results for that cluster. We can visualize the top marker genes for each cluster using a heatmap.\n\nTake my word for it that we can visualize the top marker genes for each cluster using a heatmap.

It allows us to visualize and interact with the data in real-time, making it easier to explore complex datasets and identify patterns. \n\nA key component of iSEE is the `SingleCellExperiment` object, which serves as the data container for single-cell RNA-seq data. iSEE provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data.\n\nTo use iSEE, we first need to install the `iSEE` package and then launch the iSEE app.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install iSEE package if not already installed\niSEE::iSEE(sce)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `iSEE()` function launches the iSEE app, which provides an interactive interface for exploring the `SingleCellExperiment` object.\n\nYou may want to play with a few genes to see how they are expressed across the different clusters. You can also explore the metadata associated with the cells, such as tissue type, cell type annotations, and quality control metrics. The set of \"marker genes\" we identified earlier can also be visualized in iSEE, allowing us to see how these genes are expressed across different clusters and cell types.\n\nFor cluster 1, the marker genes are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(paste(top_marker_genes_for_all_clusters[[1]],'\\n'))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAqp4 \n Cldn10 \n Clu \n Aldoc \n Ntsr2 \n Mt2 \n Fabp7 \n Gja1 \n Gpr37l1 \n Prdx6 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSee the \n\n## Bonus: Working with 10x Genomics Data\n\nIn the previous sections, we used a curated dataset from the `scRNAseq` package. However, many real-world single-cell RNA-seq datasets come from 10x Genomics platforms, which produce data in specific formats. In this section, we'll cover a hypothetical workflow for loading and processing raw 10x Genomics data using R. \n\n### Understanding 10x Genomics Output Formats\n\n10x Genomics Cell Ranger produces several output formats:\n\n1. **Matrix Market format** (`.mtx` files): Sparse matrix format with separate files for the matrix, gene names, and cell barcodes\n2. **HDF5 format** (`.h5` files): A single compressed file containing all the data\n3. **Filtered vs. unfiltered**: Cell Ranger provides both versions - filtered contains only cells that pass basic quality filters\n\n### Loading 10x Data from Matrix Market Files\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Loading from standard 10x output directory\n# This assumes you have a directory with:\n# - matrix.mtx.gz (or matrix.mtx)\n# - features.tsv.gz (or genes.tsv.gz for older versions)\n# - barcodes.tsv.gz\n\nlibrary(DropletUtils)\nlibrary(SingleCellExperiment)\n\n# Method 1: Using DropletUtils (recommended)\nsce_10x <- read10xCounts(\"path/to/10x/output/\", col.names = TRUE)\n\n# Method 2: Using Seurat (if you prefer the Seurat ecosystem)\n# library(Seurat)\n# seurat_obj <- Read10X(\"path/to/10x/output/\")\n# sce_10x <- as.SingleCellExperiment(CreateSeuratObject(seurat_obj))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**What we're doing:** The `read10xCounts()` function from DropletUtils reads the three files that comprise 10x output and creates a SingleCellExperiment object. The `col.names = TRUE` parameter ensures that cell barcodes are used as column names.\n\n**Why DropletUtils:** This package is specifically designed for handling droplet-based single-cell data (like 10x Genomics). It includes specialized functions for:\n\n- Reading 10x formats efficiently\n- Distinguishing empty droplets from cells\n- Handling ambient RNA contamination\n- Quality control specific to droplet-based methods\n\n### Loading from HDF5 Files\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For HDF5 format files\nlibrary(rhdf5)\n\n# Method 1: Using DropletUtils\nsce_h5 <- read10xCounts(\"path/to/sample.h5\", type = \"HDF5\")\n\n# Method 2: Direct HDF5 reading (more control)\nh5_file <- \"path/to/sample.h5\"\ngene_info <- h5read(h5_file, \"matrix/features\")\nbarcodes <- h5read(h5_file, \"matrix/barcodes\")\nmatrix_data <- h5read(h5_file, \"matrix/data\")\n# Additional processing needed to reconstruct sparse matrix\n```\n:::\n\n\n**What we're doing:** HDF5 files are more convenient as they contain all information in a single file. The `type = \"HDF5\"` parameter tells the function to expect this format instead of separate matrix files.\n\n**When to use H5 files:**\n\n- **Convenience**: Single file is easier to manage and transfer\n- **Speed**: Often faster to read than multiple compressed files\n- **Storage**: More efficient storage, especially for large datasets\n\n### Essential Quality Control After Loading Raw Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add mitochondrial gene information\nlibrary(scuttle)\nis.mito <- grepl(\"^MT-\", rownames(sce_10x)) # Human mitochondrial genes\n# For mouse data, use: is.mito <- grepl(\"^mt-\", rownames(sce_10x))\n\n# Calculate per-cell QC metrics\nsce_10x <- addPerCellQC(sce_10x, subsets = list(Mito = is.mito))\n\n# Calculate per-gene QC metrics\nsce_10x <- addPerFeatureQC(sce_10x)\n\n# View the QC metrics\ncolnames(colData(sce_10x))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**What we're doing:** We're calculating quality control metrics that are essential for raw 10x data:\n\n- **Mitochondrial genes**: High mitochondrial gene expression often indicates dying cells\n- **Per-cell metrics**: Total counts, number of detected genes, mitochondrial percentage\n- **Per-gene metrics**: How many cells express each gene\n\n**Why QC is crucial for raw data:** Unlike curated datasets, raw 10x data contains:\n\n- **Empty droplets**: Droplets that captured ambient RNA but no cells\n- **Dying cells**: Cells with compromised membranes\n- **Doublets**: Droplets containing multiple cells\n- **Low-quality cells**: Cells with very few detected genes\n\n### Filtering Low-Quality Cells and Genes\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Visualize QC metrics\nlibrary(scater)\nplotColData(sce_10x, x = \"sum\", y = \"detected\", colour_by = \"subsets_Mito_percent\")\n\n# Set filtering thresholds (these are examples - adjust based on your data)\n# Filter cells\nhigh_mito <- sce_10x$subsets_Mito_percent > 20  # Remove cells with >20% mitochondrial reads\nlow_lib_size <- sce_10x$sum < 1000              # Remove cells with <1000 total counts\nlow_n_features <- sce_10x$detected < 500        # Remove cells with <500 detected genes\n\n# Filter genes (remove genes expressed in very few cells)\nlow_expression <- rowSums(counts(sce_10x) > 0) < 10  # Expressed in <10 cells\n\n# Apply filters\nsce_filtered <- sce_10x[!low_expression, !(high_mito | low_lib_size | low_n_features)]\n\n# Check how many cells and genes remain\ndim(sce_10x)      # Before filtering\ndim(sce_filtered) # After filtering\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**What we're doing:** We're applying filters to remove low-quality cells and rarely expressed genes. The specific thresholds should be adjusted based on your dataset characteristics.\n\n**Understanding the filters:**\n\n- **Mitochondrial percentage**: Cells with high mitochondrial gene expression are likely dying\n- **Library size**: Total number of UMIs per cell - very low values suggest poor capture\n- **Number of features**: How many different genes are detected - very low values suggest poor quality\n- **Gene expression frequency**: Genes expressed in very few cells are often noise\n\n**Critical considerations:**\n\n- **Thresholds are dataset-dependent**: What works for one experiment may not work for another\n- **Biological vs. technical variation**: Some cell types naturally have different RNA content\n- **Visualization first**: Always plot your QC metrics before setting thresholds\n\n\n## Further Reading and Resources\n\nFor more in-depth information on single-cell RNA-seq analysis, consider the following resources:\n\n- The [Orchestrating Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis](https://osca.bioconductor.org/) book provides a comprehensive guide to single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Bioconductor.\n- The [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) package documentation offers extensive tutorials and vignettes for single-cell analysis in the Seurat ecosystem.\n",
