It is meant to \nbe largely self-directed, but for those looking to teach data science, it can\nalso be used as a guide for structuring a course. Material is a bit variable \nin terms of difficulty, prerequisites, and format which is a reflection of the\norganic creation of the material.\n\nStudents are encouraged to work with others to learn the material. Instructors \nare encouraged to use the material to create a course that is tailored to the\nneeds of their students and to spend lots of time in 1:1 and small groups\nto support students in their learning. See below for additional thoughts on \nadult learning and how it relates to this material.\n\n## Adult learners\n\nAdult Learning Theory, also known as Andragogy, is the concept and practice of\ndesigning, developing, and delivering instructional experiences for adult\nlearners. It is based on the belief that adults learn differently than\nchildren, and thus, require distinct approaches to engage, motivate, and retain\ninformation [@author_lifelong_2016]. The term was first introduced by Malcolm\nKnowles, an American educator who is known for his work in adult education\n[@knowles_adult_2005].\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of Adult Learning Theory is that adults are\nself-directed learners. This means that we prefer to take control of our\nown learning process and set personal goals for themselves. We are motivated\nby our desire to solve problems or gain knowledge to improve our lives (see @fig-why-learn). As\na result, educational content for adults should be relevant and applicable to\nreal-life situations. Furthermore, adult learners should be given opportunities\nto actively engage in the learning process by making choices, setting goals,\nand evaluating their progress.\n\n![Why do adults choose to learn something?](images/why_learn.png){#fig-why-learn}\n\nAnother key aspect of Adult Learning Theory is the role of experience. We\nbring a wealth of experience to the learning process, which serves as a\nresource for new learning. We often have well-established beliefs, values,\nand mental models that can influence our willingness to accept new ideas and\nconcepts. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge and respect our shared and unique past\nexperiences and create an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing\nour perspectives.\n\nTo effectively learn as a group of adult learners, it is crucial to establish a collaborative\nlearning environment that promotes open communication and fosters trust among\nparticipants. We all appreciate and strive for a respectful and supportive atmosphere\nwhere we can express our opinions without fear of judgment. Instructors\nshould help facilitate discussions, encourage peer-to-peer interactions, and\nincorporate group activities and collaboration to capitalize on the collective\nknowledge of participants.\n\nAdditionally, adult learners often have multiple responsibilities outside of\nthe learning environment, such as work and family commitments. As a result,\nwe require flexible learning opportunities that accommodate busy\nschedules. Offering a variety of instructional formats, such as online modules,\nself-paced learning, or evening classes, can help ensure that adult learners\nhave access to education despite any time constraints.\n\nAdult learners benefit from a learner-centered approach that focuses on\nthe individual needs, preferences, and interests of each participant can\ngreatly enhance the overall learning experience. In addition, we tend to \nbe more intrinsically motivated to learn when we have a sense of autonomy and\ncan practice and experiment (see @fig-stuck-ds) with new concepts in a safe environment. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How to stay stuck in data science (or anything). The \"Read-Do\" loop tends to deliver the best results. Too much reading between doing can be somewhat effective. Reading and simply copy-paste is probably the least effective. When working through material, experiment. Try to break things. Incorporate your own experience or applications whenever possible.](index_files/figure-epub/fig-stuck-ds-1.png){#fig-stuck-ds}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Adult Learning Theory and its \nprinciples can significantly enhance the effectiveness\nof teaching and learning as adults. By respecting our autonomy, acknowledging our\nexperiences, creating a supportive learning environment, offering flexible\nlearning opportunities, and utilizing diverse teaching methods, we can\nbetter cater to the unique needs and preferences of adult learners.\n\nIn practice, that means that we will will not be prescriptive in our approach\nto teaching data science. We will not tell you what to do, but rather we will\nprovide you with a variety of options and you can choose what works best for\nyou. We will also provide you with a variety of resources and you can choose where\nto focus your time. Given that we cannot possibly cover everything, we will\nprovide you with a framework for learning and you can fill in the gaps as you\nsee fit. A key component of our success as adult learners is to gain the confidence\nto ask questions and problem-solve on our own. \n\n",
