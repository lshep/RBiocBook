The expression profiles observed for genes with known metabolic functions pointed to features of the metabolic reprogramming that occur during the diauxic shift, and the expression patterns of many previously uncharacterized genes provided clues to their possible functions. The same DNA microarrays were also used to identify genes whose expression was affected by deletion of the transcriptional co-repressor TUP1 or overexpression of the transcriptional activator YAP1. These results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach to genomewide exploration of gene expression patterns.},

	abstract = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering—using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative—is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

	abstract = {The field of machine learning includes the development and application of computer algorithms that improve with experience.Machine learning methods can be divided into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods are trained on examples with labels (for example, 'gene' or 'not gene') and are then used to predict these labels on other examples, whereas unsupervised methods find patterns in data sets without the use of labels. Semi-supervised methods combine these two approaches, leveraging patterns in unlabelled data to improve power in the prediction of labels.Different machine learning methods may be required for an application, depending on whether one is interested in interpreting the output model or is simply concerned with predictive power. Generative models, which posit a probabilistic distribution over input data, are generally best for interpretability, whereas discriminative models, which seek only to model labels, are generally best for predictive power.Prior information can be added to a model in order to train the model more effectively when it is provided with limited data, to limit the complexity of the model or to incorporate data that are not used by the model directly. Prior information can be incorporated explicitly in a probabilistic model or implicitly through the choice of features or similarity measures.The choice of an appropriate performance measure depends strongly on the application task. Machine learning methods are most effective when they optimize an appropriate performance measure.Network estimation methods are appropriate when the data contain complex dependencies among examples. These methods work best when they take into account the confounding effects of indirect relationships.},

              Although Southern blots are the traditional method of identifying

              in different tissues, stages of development, diseases, and
              species. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear
              chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of
              identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in
              the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have
              recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library
              of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis,
              using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000
              tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T
              cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified
              14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to
              each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that
              the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites.
              Approximately 80\% of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within
              one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain
              regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes,
              CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites
              identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells,
              hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and
              HeLa cells. However, approximately 10\% of the DNase HS sites are
              lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify
              gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This
              strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will
              enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates

For most tasks, the GRanges object would suffice, but there are gaps in the API that prevent its general use. By recognizing that the GRanges class follows “tidy” data principles, we create a grammar of genomic data transformation, defining verbs for performing actions on and between genomic interval data and providing a way of performing common data analysis tasks through a coherent interface to existing Bioconductor infrastructure. We implement this grammar as a Bioconductor/R package called plyranges.},

	abstract = {Background: The tumor microenvironment is an important factor in cancer immunotherapy response. To further understand how a tumor affects the local immune system, we analyzed immune gene expression differences between matching normal and tumor tissue.Methods: We analyzed public and new gene expression data from solid cancers and isolated immune cell populations. We also determined the correlation between CD8, FoxP3 IHC, and our gene signatures.Results: We observed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) were one of the main drivers of immune gene expression differences between normal and tumor tissue. A tumor-specific CD8 signature was slightly lower in tumor tissue compared with normal of most (12 of 16) cancers, whereas a Treg signature was higher in tumor tissue of all cancers except liver. Clustering by Treg signature found two groups in colorectal cancer datasets. The high Treg cluster had more samples that were consensus molecular subtype 1/4, right-sided, and microsatellite-instable, compared with the low Treg cluster. Finally, we found that the correlation between signature and IHC was low in our small dataset, but samples in the high Treg cluster had significantly more CD8+ and FoxP3+ cells compared with the low Treg cluster.Conclusions: Treg gene expression is highly indicative of the overall tumor immune environment.Impact: In comparison with the consensus molecular subtype and microsatellite status, the Treg signature identifies more colorectal tumors with high immune activation that may benefit from cancer immunotherapy.

We discovered classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or tended to overlap with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days, we demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing an individual's epigenome on a timescale compatible with clinical decision-making.},

  abstract = {Chromatin accessibility, or the physical access to chromatinized DNA, is a widely studied characteristic of the eukaryotic genome. As active regulatory DNA elements are generally ‘accessible’, the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility can be used to identify candidate regulatory genomic regions in a tissue or cell type. Multiple biochemical methods have been developed to profile chromatin accessibility, both in bulk and at the single-cell level. Depending on the method, enzymatic cleavage, transposition or DNA methyltransferases are used, followed by high-throughput sequencing, providing a view of genome-wide chromatin accessibility. In this Primer, we discuss these biochemical methods, as well as bioinformatics tools for analysing and interpreting the generated data, and insights into the key regulators underlying developmental, evolutionary and disease processes. We outline standards for data quality, reproducibility and deposition used by the genomics community. Although chromatin accessibility profiling is invaluable to study gene regulation, alone it provides only a partial view of this complex process. Orthogonal assays facilitate the interpretation of accessible regions with respect to enhancer–promoter proximity, functional transcription factor binding and regulatory function. We envision that technological improvements including single-molecule, multi-omics and spatial methods will bring further insight into the secrets of genome regulation.},

We employed high-throughput sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites within human primary CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16\%-21\% of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure.},

  abstract = {The binding of sequence-specific regulatory factors and the recruitment of chromatin remodeling activities cause nucleosomes to be evicted from chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Traditionally, these active sites have been identified experimentally through their sensitivity to nucleases. Here we describe the details of a simple procedure for the genome-wide isolation of nucleosome-depleted DNA from human chromatin, termed FAIRE (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements). We also provide protocols for different methods of detecting FAIRE-enriched DNA, including use of PCR, DNA microarrays, and next-generation sequencing. FAIRE works on all eukaryotic chromatin tested to date. To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. Most genomic DNA is crosslinked to nucleosomes and is sequestered to the interphase, whereas DNA recovered in the aqueous phase corresponds to nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome. The isolated regions are largely coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, enhancers, insulators, and active promoters. Given its speed and simplicity, FAIRE has utility in establishing chromatin profiles of diverse cell types in health and disease, isolating DNA regulatory elements en masse for further characterization, and as a screening assay for the effects of small molecules on chromatin organization.},

We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.},
